# Analysis of data received 2020-07-01 

## Purpose
Abrar Bhat sent a spreadsheet of processed data containing some processed data 
corresponding to his light activation experiments. This data was supplied as a 
two-sheet excel document containing relative time measurements (when the
preactivation/activation) images were acquired, the power density (in nW per
micron? need to check), as we as the intensities for the preactivation,
saturation, and total mCherry intensity. The saturation intensity I believe is
the result of a parametric fit he is performing on his theoretical model.

This reflects my knowledge of the experiments thus far.
