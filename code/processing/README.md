## `processing`

This folder contains all code executed to transform or generate data. Within
this directory, there should be subdirectories that contain summaries of that
experiment, the code used to process and transform the data, and the output
of any processing functions.

All raw data processing has already been performed using MATLAB. Thus, the code
contained in this directory translates those files to tidy CSVs.
